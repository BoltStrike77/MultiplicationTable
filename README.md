# MultiplicationTable
A multiplication table for the number the user inputs. Scales sizes by moving the edges of the window.

Make sure the input is in reasonable range for your computer setup and specifications, along with the size of the multiplication table.

KNOWN ISSUE: The program may resize incorrectly occasionally, usually by entering a table, moving the window, and entering multiple tables in a row (or other scenarios).
